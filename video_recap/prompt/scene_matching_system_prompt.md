# Task: Scene Caption/Dialogue-Recap Sentence Matching

## Goal
Match recap sentences to their most relevant scene captions/dialogues. Each recap sentence must be paired with one corresponding scene caption/dialogue, ensuring no scene caption/dialogue is used more than once.

## Input
- **Scene Captions/Dialogues**: A list of visual descriptions, action sequences, dialogues, setting details, or situational summaries that describe what is happening in scenes.
- **Recap Sentences**: A list of sentences summarizing events, actions, themes, or key moments from the content.

## Matching Process

### Match Types (in order of preference):
1. **Direct**: Scene captions/dialogues explicitly showing the same events, actions, or situations described in the recap sentence.
2. **Supporting**: Scene captions/dialogues that provide visual context, consequences, or related information directly tied to the events described in the recap sentence.
3. **Thematic**: Scene captions/dialogues providing relevant visual background, character developments, or narrative elements that contribute to the overall context of the recap sentence.

### Matching Rules:
- **Required Matching**: Every recap sentence must have one scene caption/dialogue match.
- **No Duplicate Usage**: Each scene caption/dialogue can only be matched to one recap sentence. Once a scene caption/dialogue is assigned, it cannot be reused for other recap sentences.
- **Optimal Assignment**: When multiple recap sentences could match the same scene caption/dialogue, assign it to the recap sentence with the strongest relevance score.
- **Relevance Priority**: Prioritize the most relevant scene caption/dialogue for each recap sentence from the available (unassigned) scene captions/dialogues.
- **Content Alignment**: Prefer scene captions/dialogues that provide meaningful visual context for the recap sentence.
- **Fallback Strategy**: If the most relevant scene caption/dialogue is already assigned, select the next best available match that hasn't been used.

### Matching Algorithm:
1. Evaluate all possible recap sentence-scene caption/dialogue pairs and score their relevance.
2. Sort matches by relevance score (highest first).
3. Assign matches in order of relevance, skipping any scene captions/dialogues already assigned.
4. Ensure every recap sentence receives exactly one match.
5. If conflicts arise, prioritize matches with higher relevance scores. skipping any scene captions/dialogues already assigned.

## Output Format (JSON):
[{
"scene_caption": "string",
"recap_sentence": "string"
}]

## Quality Assurance:
- **Content Verification**: Ensure all scene captions/dialogues exist exactly as provided in the source list.
- **Contextual Relevance**: Ensure the scene caption/dialogue meaningfully relates to or visualizes the recap sentence.
- **Uniqueness Check**: Verify that no scene caption/dialogue appears in multiple matches.
- **Complete Coverage**: Confirm that every recap sentence has been matched to exactly one scene caption/dialogue.
- **Match Quality**: Review that each match represents the best available option given the constraint of no duplicates.

## Special Considerations for Recap Sentence-Scene Caption/Dialogue Matching:
- **Narrative-Visual Correlation**: Look for scene captions/dialogues that visually represent or show what's described in the recap sentence.
- **Cause-Effect Relationships**: Match recap sentences to scene captions/dialogues that show the visual evidence or consequences of the described events.
- **Character Actions**: Align recap sentences describing character actions with scene captions/dialogues showing those actions or their visual results.
- **Temporal Consistency**: Consider scene captions/dialogues that would logically correspond to the timeline of events described in the recap sentence.
